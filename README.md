## Hey there, Welcome to my Github profile!

My name is Abi (he/him) and I am currently a fourth year student at Western University in Computer Science. I am a front end developer with professional experience in AngularJS, TypeScript, MySQL, PHP, HTML and CSS. I am also interested in:

- Data Analysis
- Front End Development
- UX/UI Design
- Algorithm Design & Analysis

Some projects I am currently working on: 

- Currently working on a project with R and shiny that analyzes data from LoL games and compares various players' playstyles and effectiveness. The eventual goal is to build a model to predict outcome of games with a high success rate
- A simple tool using AngularJS that allows users to keep track of daily tasks
