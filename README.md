## Hey there, Welcome to my Github profile!

Welcome to my Github profile! I am a recent graduate from Western University in Computer Science. I am a front end developer with professional experience in AngularJS, TypeScript, MySQL, PHP, HTML and CSS. I am also interested in:

- Data Analysis
- Front End Development
- UX/UI Design
- Algorithm Design & Analysis
- Software Testing

Some projects I am currently working on: 

- Currently working on a project with R and shiny that analyzes data from LoL games and compares various players' playstyles and effectiveness. The eventual goal is to build a model to predict outcome of games with a high success rate
- AngularJS app in order to keep track of daily tasks with a pomodoro timer
- A simple webscraper in Python using beautifulsoup that scrapes several fantasy baseball websites and creates an abstract ranking system based on rankings already provided
